  description: `Today, the technology scene is witnessing a gigantic evolution due to the increasing demands on artificial intelligence, which should occupy the world market in the coming years.
As we know, the current health situation in Tunisia is suffering because of the third wave of the sars-cov2 pandemic.
Given the exponential growth of the infected and the lack of vaccines and tests, we are looking for a solution that allows us to reduce the rate of infection, through providing a virtual platform accessible to all Tunisians that allows us to predict if anyone is affected by the virus or not.`,
